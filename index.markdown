Attention all hobbyist hardware hackers and engineers! Are you tired of sifting through piles of disorganised electronic components and struggling to keep track of what you have? Look no further!

This simple to use application, complete with intuitive search features and a simple flat taxonomy model, is designed specifically with you in mind. Say goodbye to the chaos and hello to a streamlined system for keeping track of your parts inventory, making your next electrical experiment smoother than ever.

Whether you're an amateur hobbyist or a seasoned engineer, partsbin is the perfect tool to help you stay organised, productive, and get ahead of the game.

It's free, open source with a liberal license (MIT), and easy to install via a Docker image, which can sit on a home server or on your lab PC. It is web based (using Blazor) and works well with tablets and mobile devices as well.

It's totally self-hostedâ€”I have no plans to develop any kind of security or user management, so you should make sure it's restricted to your home/work network.

The design also means that multiple users and concurrency may be an issue. This has only been tested with a single user at a time. It really is a small scale hobbyist tool.

The only big downside is... it hasn't been released yet.

So hang in there :-)

partsbin is a project by [Rebecca Scott](https://becdetat.com), allegedly a human who codes and plays with Arduinos, and pays for hundreds of dollars of components at ebay and aliexpress by working as an IT consultant at [SixPivot](https://sixpivot.com.au).
