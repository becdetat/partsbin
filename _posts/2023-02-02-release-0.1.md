Yay, the first release!

Here's a quick feature list currently in place.
- You can create a part!
- Parts can have the following features:
    - _Part type_, for example `Capacitor` or `Arduino Uno Dev Board`
    - _Range_, for example `Arduino Uno` or `ESP8266`
    - _Part name_, for example `WiFi Mini ESP8266`
    - _Package type_, for example `DIP`
    - _Value_, for example `0.1` - this is just a text value, the unit value is separate
    - _Value type_, for example `uF` or `R`
    - _Part number_, for example `XC3802` or `SN74HC595`
    - _Quantity_, the number of this specific part you have on hand (and in the location)
    - _Location_, where you've stored these parts
    - _Manufacturer_, the manufacturer of this specific part
    - _Notes_, a rich text entry location for any notes you have for the part, including images!
- Parts can be duplicated, then modified
- Parts can be deletedâ€”to a rubbish bin, where it can be restored if you've made a terrible, terrible mistake
- If you are storing the same part in different locations (such as in two different containers) you would create one part entry for the first location, then duplicate it and set the quantity and location for the second location
- If you've got the same part but made by different manufacturers, and store them in the same place, you can just leave the _Manufacturer_ feature empty
- List pages for all parts, and broken down by location, manufacturer, part name, part type, and range
- Search functionality when adding/editing a part for the part type, range, part name, package type, value unit, manufacturer, and location
- Fuzzy search over relevant fields on parts
- A big button in the admin page to reindex tha parts, if something went wrong (please [let me know](https://github.com/becdetat/partsbin/issues) if something goes wrong...)
- Home page featuring locations, manufacturers, and part types

The following features for the next release:
- Adding _documents_ to a part, such as data sheets or development guides
- Adding _suppliers_ to a part, so you can track the best (or worst) places to obtain new parts
